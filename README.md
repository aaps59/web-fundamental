Though most internet users tend to look at website's for their literal face value- what's shown, pictures, text, and various widgets- there's a ton that has to go on behind the scenes.
Sites are built off of hardware like servers, then software built up by varying kinds of code. 

When loading a web page, a URL, or a web address, is entered and a HyperText Transfer Protocol is established. This makes it so two computers can swap data. 
One computer, the client, is what a user surfs the web on with help of a web browser, and the server connected to the inputted URL relays info to that web browser.
The client's browser requests certain data, and the server mulls itself to check if it can pull the requested data.

HyperText Markup Language is the dialogue used between computers that allows the machines to swap files via the internet. 
Using specific HTML tags, web browsers are able to identify the various defining parts of a web site, such as images and fonts.

The internet and the World Wide Web are two similar yet different things. 
The internet is a complete system of computers that's connected by telephone cables, and it's what the WWW runs off of to transmit data from machine to machine. 

The web browser is the tool that users use to directly access web addresses. It's the program that analyzes the HTML data that a website is built off of. 
Some examples of browsers would be Opera, Google Chrome, Apple's Safari, Mozilla's FireFox, Microsoft's Internet Explorer and so on.
